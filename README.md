# Soil Image Recognition Project

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

This project is all about recognizing different types of soil using images. The idea came from wanting to use computer vision and machine learning to analyze soil characteristics automatically from pictures. 
These were my initial projects with not solid results but a good understanding for whats happening.

### Whatâ€™s it about?

Basically, you feed in a photo of soil, and the system tries to figure out what type of soil it is based on patterns, texture, and color. Itâ€™s a fun way to combine image processing with some cool algorithms to solve a practical problem related to agriculture, environment, or gardening.
I have applied a Basic CNN architecture , optimizing the CNN architecture with the Dragonfly , particle swarn , Ant-lion and whale algorithm.
### How did it start?

This started as a simple idea to see if machines could learn to "see" soil types like we do. I gathered some soil images, experimented with image processing techniques, and set up a model that tries to classify these images into different soil categories.

### Why?

Soil quality and type matter a lot for planting and farming. Automating this through image recognition opens doors for smarter agricultural tools and more accessible field analysis.

### Whatâ€™s inside?

- Preprocessing scripts to clean and prepare images
- A machine learning model (nothing fancy, just a basic starter)
- Some basic evaluation (because, hey, gotta check if it's working!)
